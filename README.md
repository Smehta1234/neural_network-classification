# neural_network-classification
This project demonstrates the use of a simple neural network for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The goal of the project is to classify images of clothing into one of ten categories, such as shirts, shoes, or bags, using a feedforward neural network.
